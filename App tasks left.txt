Things that are left to do to finish the app
These need to be finished to have complete functionality
1.Finish setting up the creation of a report by sending it to the database end
2.Add the automatic update feature of geolocation of a current report
3.Get the status report checker to work
4. Clean up the text and add the rest of the information

These don't need to be finished before we are techinically done. These are considered not necessary functionality
1.Add functionality to be able to send pictures
2.Clean up the UI and make it look pretty
3.Add confirmation pop up for the user when they submit a report
4.Add a pop that will ask them if they are sure they want to submit the report
I believe that is everything
